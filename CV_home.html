        <div id="twoColumns"> My name is Tina Banze. I was born in 1989 in the German Democratic Republic as a
            mixed-race
            Black German and lived in a small town in Eastern Germany until I finished high school. I then studied
            Romance
            philologies at the University
            of Leipzig. After my Master's degree, I realised on the job market that studying humanities was fun but
            didn't
            pay much. So I decided to gain further qualifications and first obtained my BAMF licence to teach German
            as
            a foreign language while working and later studied social work at a distance-learning university
            (Bachelor's
            degree) and at ASH Berlin (Master's degree). <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                <br>
                <br>I have been working in the social field for 9
                years,
                mostly in schools. I managed projects for four employers, the last project being responsible for 20
                employees. Due to the social skills I gained during this time, I decided to train as an IT project
                manager
                and SCRUM Master. I now work full-time as an IT
                project manager.
                <br>
                <br>
                After leaving school, I rarely stayed in one place for long and lived in different countries. In these
                always very different settings, I gained valuable knowledge and insights which, in addition to my
                professional qualifications, are an enrichment for globally networked and operating companies.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am open to
                venturing into new spheres professionally in order to be able to apply and deepen my communicative,
                language
                skills as well as my socio-educational knowledge from critical diversity management to project
                management to
                personnel development.
